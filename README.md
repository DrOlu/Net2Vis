# NetViz-Zoom
With this project, we try to visualize neural networks in a more intuitive way. We noticed that, for most cases, visualizations are either too detailed or too general. Therefore, we aim to provide a zoomable layout that spans everything from figures found in papers or online to very detailed explanations of indicidual network components.
